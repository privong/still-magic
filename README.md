## Overall Design

-   Markdown source files for each human language are in a [collection](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/collections/) named after the language.
    -   E.g., `_en` for English.

-   Every file has a unique slug.  Using the English version as an example:
    -   File's name is `_en/slug.md`.
    -   File's permalink is `/en/slug/`.
    -   Generated HTML is `_site/en/slug/index.html`.
    -   Chapter ID is `s:slug` and section IDs are `s:slug-something`.
    -   Figure IDs are `f:slug-something`.
    -   Entry in Jekyll configuration's table of contents is `/slug/`.
    -   Source for all diagrams for the file are in `./figures/slug.xml` (a [draw.io](https://www.draw.io/) drawing).
    -   PNG, SVG, and PDF versions of diagrams are in `./figures/slug-something.suffix`.

-   Every Markdown file's YAML must contain two fields:
    -   `permalink`: must be `/lang/slug/` as described above.
    -	`title`: the file's title.

-   Lessons must also contain:
    -	`questions`: a point-form list of motivating questions (lessons only).
    -	`objectives`: a point-form list of learning objectives (lessons only).
    -   `keypoints`: a point-form list of key points for a cheat sheet (lessons only).

-   The `index.md` file for each language (e.g., `_en/index.md`) must also contain `root: true` to control formatting properly.

-   Use pure Jekyll to create HTML for GitHub Pages: do not pre-process and commit generated files.
    -	Some inclusions loop over the table of contents to match slugs to files because Jekyll doesn't support lookup by key.
    -   Use the JavaScript in `./js/site.js` to patch up some references, construct per-page table of contents, etc.
    -   All-in-one HTML version generated dynamically by JavaScript so as not to require pre-commit compilation.
        -   `all/lang.html` is a placeholder that goes into `_site/lang/all/index.html` (for each language `lang`).
        -   `./js/stitch.js` runs in this file, loads all the other files dynamically, and stitches them together.

-   Use Pandoc with pre- and post-processing to convert Markdown to LaTeX to build PDF.
    -   Most of the pre/post-processing uses `sed` directly in `Makefile`.
    -	Easier for newcomers to understand and maintain than a custom Pandoc template.

-   We use a script to regenerate the Markdown bibliography (e.g., `_en/bib.md`) from the BibTeX source (e.g., `tex/en/book.bib`).
    -   Yeah, this is a server-side compilation step...

-   Links are written in four ways:
    -   Inter-chapter links are `[text](../slug/)`.
    -	External links are `[text][link-name]`, where `link-name` is a key in `./_includes/links.md`
    	-   `./_includes/links.md` is included explicitly at the bottom of every Markdown file because including it in the template doesn't work.
    -   Bibliographic citations are written as `[Key1234](#BIB)`.
    	-   Keys are found in `_en/bib.md`.
	-   JavaScript replaces `#BIB` with a link to the bibliography.
    -   Glossary entries are written as `[term](#g:key)`.
    	-   `g:key` must be found in `_en/gloss.md`.
	-   JavaScript patches this to link to the glossary file.

## Layout

-   `./README.md`: this file.
    -   Not processed by Jekyll.
-   `./CITATION.md`, `./CONDUCT.md`, `./LICENSE.md`: how to cite, code of conduct, and license respectively.
    -   Not processed by Jekyll.
    -	Redundant (information is also in `_en/filename.md`) but people expect to find these in the root directory.
-   `Makefile`: re-build everything.
    -   `make` prints a list of targets.
    -	Can regenerate HTML and PDF, check file consistency, count words, etc.
    -   Use `make lang=xx` to run commands for a particular human language (e.g., `make lang=en` to build the English version).
-   `_config.yml`: Jekyll configuration file.
    -   Simple values defined at the top (e.g., `title` and `subtitle`).
    -	`toc` is table of contents, and has three sub-keys:
    	-   `lessons` for the main body.
	-   `bib` for the bibliography (single entry).
	-   `extras` for appendices.
    -	Each entry must match a file's slug, in slashes.
-   `./_en/`: English-language collection of Markdown files.
-   `./_includes/`: inclusions
    -   `./_includes/contributing.md`: how to contribute (included in several places).
    -   `./_includes/disclaimer.html`: temporary disclaimer about files being under development.
    -   `./_includes/foot.html`: everything needed in the foot of the page.
    -   `./_includes/head.html`: everything needed in the head of the page that doesn't depend on configuration variables.
    -   `./_includes/links.md`: table of Markdown-formatted links.
    -   `./_includes/listblock.html`: displays a point-form list of lesson metadata (e.g., questions or key points).
    -   `./_includes/summary.html`: summarizes metadata from all lessons (e.g., creates a page of learning objectives).
    -   `./_includes/toc-bib.html`: display the bibliography in the table of contents.
    -   `./_includes/toc-section.html`: display lessons or extras in the table of contents.
    -   `./_includes/toc.html`: display the entire table of contents.
-   `./_layouts/`: page layouts.
    -   `./_layouts/default.html`: base layout (used directly only for the overall index page for the whole site).
    -	`./_layouts/lesson.html`: derived layout for all lesson pages.
-   `./_site/`: if present, holds the HTML pages generated by Jekyll.
-   `./all/`: holds the placeholder files used for the all-in-one versions of the site (per language).
    -   E.g., `./all/en.html` becomes `_site/en/all/index.html`.
    -	Placed here rather than in the language directory `_en` because it needs to be handled specially.
-   `./bin/`: scripts used to build and check the site.
    -   `./bin/bib2md.py`: convert BibTeX bibliography to Markdown.
    -   `./bin/checkchars.py`: check for non-7-bit characters in files.
    -   `./bin/checkcites.py`: check for unused and undefined bibliographic citations.
    -   `./bin/checkfigs.py`: check for unused and missing figures.
    -   `./bin/checkgloss.py`: check for unused and undefined glossary entries.
    -   `./bin/checklinks.py`: check for unused and undefined links in `./_includes/links.md`.
    -   `./bin/checksrc.py`: check for unused and missing source files in `./src/`.
    -   `./bin/checktoc.py`: check for unused or missing files compared to table of contents in `./_config.yml`.
    -   `./bin/cites.py`: handle citations during Markdown-to-LaTeX transformation (because `sed` can't do this one step).
    -   `./bin/uncode.py`: remove code blocks (used in counting words).
    -   `./bin/util.py`: utilities used by other scripts.
-   `./css/`: CSS files
    -   `./css/bootstrap.min.css`: [Bootstrap 4](https://getbootstrap.com/)
    -   `./css/tango.css`: [Pygments Tango theme](https://jwarby.github.io/jekyll-pygments-themes/languages/javascript.html)
    -   `./css/site.css`: custom definitions.
-   `./etc/`: holding area for files that aren't being used right now but might be (re-)added later.
-   `./favicon.ico`: toolbar icon.
-   `./figures/`: [draw.io](https://www.draw.io/) source for figures and all exported figures.
-   `./files/`: miscellaneous image files used in website (e.g., license logo).
-   `./index.md`: overall home page for site (redirects to English-language version).
-   `./js/`: JavaScript files for site.
    -   `./js/all-in-one.js`: create all-in-one HTML version in the browser (uses `concatenate.js`).

-   `./misc/`: miscellaneous files that don't belong elsewhere.
-   `./project/`: the running example used throughout the lessons.
    -   Put in a sub-directory so that it can be structured the way a real project would be.
-   `./requirements.txt`: Pip installation requirements.
    -   Run with `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
-   `./src/`: source files used in Markdown, broken down by chapter.
-   `./tex/`: LaTeX files used to create PDF.
    -   `./tex/settings.tex`: package inclusions, macro definitions, etc.
    -   `./tex/lang/book.tex`: main file for book.
