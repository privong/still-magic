-   Previous lesson talked about the physical structure of a project
-   This one talks about the social structure
-   Sources:
    -   *[Producing Open Source Software][producing-oss]* describes how good open source software projects are run
    -   [Boll2014](#BIB) explains what a [commons](#g:commons) is and when it's an appropriate model
-   Avoid [the tyranny of structurelessness][tyranny-structurelessness]
    -   Every group of people has a power structure
    -   Only question is whether it is formal and accountable,
        or informal and unaccountable

## How Should I License My Software, Data, and Reports? {#s:inclusive-license}

-   If the law or a publication agreement prevents people from reading your work or using your software,
    you're excluding them
    -   And probably hurting your own career
-   Creative works are automatically eligible for intellectual property (and thus copyright) protection
-   Every creative work has some sort of license - the only question is whether authors and users know what it is
-   See [Mori2012](#BIB) and [this blog post][vanderplas-licensing] for overviews from a scientist's point of view
-   Every repository (version control or otherwise) should therefore include an explicit license
    -   Usually `LICENSE` or `LICENSE.txt` in root directory
    -   Clearly states under which license(s) the content is being made available
    -   Plural because code, data, and text may be covered by different licenses
-   Choose a license early
    -   Otherwise, each time a new collaborator starts contributing,
        they will hold copyright on their work
        and will thus need to be asked for approval when a license is chosen
-   **Don't write your own**, even if you are a lawyer
    -   Legalese is a highly technical language, and words don't mean what you think they mean
-   A few licenses are by far the most popular
    -   Choosing a common license makes project more intelligible
    -   [Open Source Inititative][osi-license-list] license list
    -   [choosealicense.com][choose-license] will help you find a license that suits your needs
-   Considerations:
    1.  Do you want to license the code at all?
    2.  Is the content you are licensing source code?
    3.  Do you require people distributing derivative works to also distribute their code?
    4.  Do you want to address patent rights?
    5.  Is your license compatible with the licenses of the software you depend on?
        -   E.g., can't use MIT on top of GPL
-   Licenses for software
    -   [MIT/BSD](#g:mit-license): do whatever you want as long as you cite the original source,
        and the authors accept no responsibility if things go wrong
    -   [GPL](#g:gpl): as above, but requires similar sharing

> You may copy, distribute and modify the software as long as you track changes/dates in source files.
> Any modifications to or software including (via compiler) GPL-licensed code must also be made available under the GPL
> along with build & install instructions.

-   We recommend MIT
    -   Fewest complications down the road
    -   The last thirty years shows that it's good enough to keep work open
-   Use [Creative Commons][creative-commons] licenses for data and manuscripts
    -   Written and checked by lawyers
    -   Well understood by the community
-   [CC-0](#g:cc-0): public domain
    -   Usually the best choice for data, since it simplifies aggregate analysis
-   [CC-BY](#g:cc-by): do whatever you want as long as you cite the original source
    -   Use for manuscripts, since you *want* people to share them widely
-   Other restrictions all inhibit specific use cases
    -   -ND: no derivative works (e.g., prevents translation or reformatting)
    -   -NC: no commercial use without explicit permission
        -   Some publishers try to imply that -NC means *nobody* can make money from it, which is untrue
    -   -SA: share-alike

## Why Should I Establish a Code of Conduct for My Project? {#s:inclusive-conduct}

-   FIXME: [Auro2018](#BIB)
-   A CoC lays out the expectations for personal interaction in your project
    -   Explicitly communicate standards to which this project holds its participants
    -   Encourages newcomers to engage with the project
-   Important to make clear how to report and who handles
    -   Without that, it's meaningless
-   We recommend the [Contributor Covenant][covenant]
    -   Provides examples of acceptable and unacceptable behavior for your project
    -   Specifies how unacceptable behavior will be handled
    -   Specifically designed for project contributors rather than conference participants
    -   Use the [model code of conduct][model-coc] from the [Geek Feminism Wiki][geek-feminism] for in-person events
-   Reduces the uncertainty that project participants face about what is acceptable and unacceptable behavior
    -   While you might think this is obvious,
        long experience suggests that articulating it clearly and concisely reduces problems caused by have different expectations
    -   You don't expect to have a fire, but every large building or event should have a fire safety plan
-   Welcomes newcomers specifically, which can help grow your project and encourage user feedback
    -   Particularly important for people from marginalized groups, who hae probably experienced harassment or unwelcoming behavior before
    -   Having a CoC signals that your project is trying to be a better place than YouTube, Twitter, and other cesspools
-   It delineates responsibilities within the project and provides specific points of contact in case of misconduct or harassment,
    as well as specifying the process to be followed in these cases
-   Some people may (still) push back claiming that it's unnecessary, or that it infringes freedom of speech, or...
    -   What they really mean is that thinking about unfairness that may have benefited from makes them uncomfortable
    -   In our experience, that is also a very useful filter on contributors...

## How Can I Be a Good Ally for Members of Marginalized Groups? {#s:inclusive-ally}

-   Drawn primarily from [Frameshift Consulting Ally Skills Workshop][ally-skills]
    -   Which you should attend if you can
-   Privilege: an unearned advantage given by society to some people but not all
-   Oppression: systemic, pervasive inequality that benefits the privileged and harms those without privilege
-   Target: someone who suffers from oppression
    -   Often called "a member of a marginalized group", but that phrasing is deliberately passive
    -   Targets don't choose to be marginalized: those with privilege marginalize them
-   Ally: a member of a privileged group who is working to understand their own privilege and end oppression
-   Example
    -   Privilege: being able to walk into a store and have the owner assume you're there to buy things, not to steal them
    -   Oppression: the self-perpetuating stories told about (for example) indigenous people being thieves,
        and the actions people take as a result of them
    -   Target: an indigenous person who wants to buy milk
    -   Ally: a white person who pays attention to lesson like this one (raising their own awareness),
        calls out peers who spread racist stories (peer action),
        or asks the shopkeeper whether they should leave too (situational action)
-   Why be an ally?
    -   Because you can:
        taking action to value diversity results in worse performance ratings for minority and female leaders,
        while ethnic majority or male leaders who do this aren't penalized [Hekm2017](#BIB)
    -   Because you have benefited, even if you don't realize it
    -   As soon as you acknowledge that (for example) women are called on less often than men,
        or are less likely to get an interview or a publication given identical work,
        you have to acknowledge that white and Asian males are *more* likely to get these benefits than their performance alone deserves
    -   See discussion above about willingness or refusal to acknowledge this being a good filter on project participants
1.  Be short, simple, firm
1.  Don't try to be funny
1.  Play for the audience
1.  Practice simple responses
1.  Pick your battles
1.  Don't shame or insult one group when trying to help another
    -   E.g., don't call someone ugly or stupid when what you really mean is that they're racist or homophobic
-   [Captain Awkward][captain-awkward] has useful advice
-   [Charles' Rules of Argument][charles-rules] are very useful online
    1.  Don't go looking for an argument
    1.  State your position once, speaking to the audience
    1.  Wait for absurd replies
    1.  Reply once more to correct any misunderstandings of your original statement
    1.  Do not reply again - go do something fun instead
-   Recognize that good principles sometimes conflict
    -   "A manager consistently uses male pronouns to refer to software and people of unknown gender.
        When you tell them it makes you uncomfortable to treat maleness as the norm,
        they say that male is the default gender in their first language
        and you should be more considerate of people from other cultures."
    -   Respect for other cultures vs. being inclusive of women
    -   In this case, discomfort of changing pronouns is less than career harm caused by being exclusionary
-   Change the terms of the debate
    -   "Why should we take diversity into account when hiring? Why don't we just hire the best candidate?"
    -   Because taking diversity into account *is* hiring the best candidate
    -   If you can run a mile in four minutes, and I can do it in 4:15 with a ball and chain on my leg, which one of us is the better athlete?
    -   Which one of us will perform better *if the impediment is removed*?
    -   So sure, if you intend to preserve an exclusionary culture in this lab,
        considering how much someone has achieved despite systemic unfairness might not make sense,
        but you're not arguing for that, are you?
