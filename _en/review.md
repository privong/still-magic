The biggest benefit of having a second person work on a programming project
is not getting twice as much code written,
but having code reviewed.
Study after study over more than 40 years has shown that code review is the most effective way to find bugs in software
{% include b key="Faga1976,Faga1986,Cohe2010,Bacc2013" %}.
Despite this,
it still isn't common in research software development,
in part because it isn't part of the culture {% include b key="Sega2005" %},
but also because code review is mostly useful
when the reviewers understand the problem domain well enough to comment on algorithms and design choices
rather than indentation and variable naming,
and the number of people who can do that for a research project is typically very small---sometimes
as small as one {% include b key="Petr2014" %}.
