Programs should report things that go wrong.
They should also sometimes report things that go right
so that people can monitor their progress
and down the sources of errors.
Adding `print` statements for debugging is a common approach,
but removing them or commenting them out,
only to add them again,
is tedious---especially when the software is in production.

A better approach is to use a [logging framework](#g:logging-framework),
such as Python's `logging` library.
This lets you leave your debugging statements in your code
and turn them on or off at will.
It also lets you send output to any of several destinations,
which is helpful when your data analysis pipeline has several stages
and you're trying to figure out which one contains a bug
(or whether the problem lies in their interaction).

## How can my program report its activity consistently? {#s:logging-basic}

Suppose you wanted to turn print statements in your program on or off
depending on how much detail you wanted to see.
You might wind up writing code like this:

```python
DEBUG_LEVEL = 2 # or some other number

def complex_function():
    # ...lots of complicated code...
    if (DEBUG_LEVEL > 0):
        print('Everything seems to be going well')
    # ...more complicated code...
    if (DEBUG_LEVEL > 1):
        print('Current alpha value {}'.format(alpha))
```

The value of `DEBUG_LEVEL` acts as a threshold:
any debugging output at a lower level isn't printed.

Logging frameworks combine the `if` and the `print` statements,
and define standard names for the levels.
In order of increasing severity, the levels are:

-   `DEBUG`: very detailed information used for localizing errors.
-   `INFO`: confirmation that things are working as expected.
-   `WARNING`: something unexpected happened, but the program will keep going.
-   `ERROR`: something has gone badly wrong, but the program hasn't hurt anything.
-   `CRITICAL`: potential loss of data, security breach, etc.

Each of these has a corresponding function:
we can use `logging.debug`, `logging.info`, etc. to write messages at these levels.
By default,
only `WARNING` and above are displayed;
messages appear on [standard error](#g:stderr) so that the flow of data in pipes isn't affected.
The source of the message appears as well:
by default, the source is called "root" for reasons that will become clear later.
Thus,
if we run the small program shown below,
only the warning message appears:

```python
import logging

logging.warning('This is a warning.')
logging.info('This is just for information.')
```
{: title="logging/simple-logging.py"}
```text
WARNING:root:This is a warning.
```

## How can I control where log messages go and which log messages appear? {#s:logging-control}

We can configure logging to send messages to a file instead of to standard error
using `logging.basicConfig`.
This has to be done before we make any logging calls: it's not retroactive.
We can use the same function to set the logging level:
everything at or above the specified level is displayed.

```python
import logging

logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG, filename='everything.log')

logging.debug('This is for debugging.')
logging.info('This is just for information.')
logging.warning('This is a warning.')
logging.error('Something went wrong.')
logging.critical('Something went seriously wrong.')
```
{: title="logging/configure-logging.py"}
```text
DEBUG:root:This is for debugging.
INFO:root:This is just for information.
WARNING:root:This is a warning.
ERROR:root:Something went wrong.
CRITICAL:root:Something went seriously wrong.
```

By default,
`basicConfig` re-opens the log file in [append mode](#g:append-mode);
we can use `filemode='w'` to overwrite the existing log data.
This is useful during debugging,
but we should think twice before doing in production,
since the information we throw away always turns out to have been exactly what we needed to find a bug.

Many programs allow users to specify logging levels and log file names as command-line parameters.
At its simplest,
this is a single flag `-v` or `--verbose` that changes the logging level from `WARNING` (the default)
to `DEBUG` (the noisiest level).
There may also be a corresponding flag `-q` or `--quiet` that changes the level to `ERROR`,
and a flag `-l` or `--logfile` that specifies a log file name
(with standard error being the default for message output).

More sophisticated programs may allow <code>--level <em>name</em><code>,
such as `--level INFO`.
If you don't mind asking users to type in ALL CAPS,
you can have them give a logging level name on the command line
and pass directly to `logging.basicConfig`,
since strings can be used as level names:

```python
basicConfig(level="DEBUG") # the same as basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)
```

The flag names `-v`, `--quiet, and so on are just conventions,
but they are widely used.

## How can I change the format of my log messages? {#s:logging-format}

By default,
`logging` producess messages with the name of the level (such as `WARNING`),
the name of the logger (we have only seen `root` so far)
and the message.
We can put whatever we want in the message,
but `logging` also allows us to specify a [format string](#g:format-string)
using the conventions of an older form of string formatting.
The general form is `%(NAME)s` to insert a named value as a string;
some of the names supported are:

-   `asctime` to get the current time,
-   `levelname` to get the logging level, and
-   `message` to get the message.

As the example below shows,
we can also change the format used for displaying dates.
We should *always* use [ISO date format](#g:iso-date-format):
it is unambiguous,
easy for other programs to parse,
easy to sort:

```python
logging.basicConfig(format='%(asctime)s,%(levelname)s,"%(message)s"', datefmt='%Y-%m-%d:%H:%M:%S')
logging.warning('This is a warning')
```
{: title="logging/message-format.py"}
```text
2019-01-05:06:16:58,WARNING,"This is a warning"
```

Our output looks like readable CSV data:
the date, a comma, the level, another comma, and then the log message in quotes.
This is deliberate:
CSV is the lowest common denominator of data formats,
so logging in that format means that we don't have to write a bunch of regular expressions later
to pull records out of our log.
Remember
if you need to write a parser, you've done something wrong ([CHAPTER](../rules/)).

## How can I handle multiple reporting sources in one program? {#s:logging-source}

Suppose we have a data analysis pipeline with two stages:
one that gets words from files,
and another that counts words.
If we want to log the actions of both,
how will we tell their log messages apart?
We could have each stage write to its own log file.
but then it would be hard to figure out which activities in stage 1
corresponded to activities in stage 2.
If we have them write messages to the same log file,
on the other hand,
how will we know which messages came from which stage?

The answer is that we can configure logging to write to the same output
with different source names.
By default,
the source name is `root` (which we have been seeing so far),
but we can define our own,
and set different levels for different loggers.

Unfortunately,
changing the name of the logging source is the one thing we *can't* easily do with `basicConfig`.
Instead,
we have to:

-   Ask `logging` to create a logger,
-   create a handler to send messages to a file,
-   create a formatter to format those messages, and then
-   stitch them together so that the logger knows about the handler
    and the handler knows about the formatter.

Time to write a function:

```python
import logging

MESSAGE_FORMAT = '%(asctime)s,%(name)s,%(levelname)s,%(message)s'
DATE_FORMAT = '%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S'

def create_logger(name, level, filename):

    # Create logger.
    logger = logging.getLogger(name)
    logger.setLevel(level)

    # Send messages to standard output.
    handler = logging.FileHandler(filename)

    # Define format.
    formatter = logging.Formatter(MESSAGE_FORMAT, DATE_FORMAT)

    # Stitch everything together.
    handler.setFormatter(formatter)
    logger.addHandler(handler)

    return logger
```
{: title="logging/util.py"}

To show how it works,
here is a function that pretends to get words from a file,
sending the words it finds to standard output
and writing log messages at `WARNING` level to `log.csv`
(so the `DEBUG`-level message shouldn't appear):

```python
from util import create_logger

logger = create_logger('get_words', 'WARNING', 'log.csv')

for word in ['first', 'second', 'third']:
    print(word)
    message = 'getting word "{}"'.format(word)
    logger.debug(message)
    logger.warn(message)
    logger.critical(message)
```
{: title="logging/get_words.py"}

And here's another function that counts words it reads from standard input,
writing log messages to the same file at `ERROR` level
(so the `DEBUG` and `WARNING` messages shouldn't appear):

```python
import sys
from util import create_logger

logger = create_logger('count_words', 'ERROR', 'log.csv')

count = 0
for line in sys.stdin:
    count += 1
    message = 'counter {} for {}'.format(count, line.strip())
    logger.debug(message)
    logger.warn(message)
    logger.error(message)
print(count)
```
{: title="logging/count_words.py"}

When we put these to programs in a pipeline,
all we see is the count:

```shell
$ python get_words.py | python count_words.py
3
```

<!-- == \noindent -->
but when we look in `log.csv`,
we see the messages from both programs:

```text
2019-01-05T06:43:04,get_words,WARNING,getting word "first"
2019-01-05T06:43:04,get_words,CRITICAL,getting word "first"
2019-01-05T06:43:04,get_words,WARNING,getting word "second"
2019-01-05T06:43:04,get_words,CRITICAL,getting word "second"
2019-01-05T06:43:04,get_words,WARNING,getting word "third"
2019-01-05T06:43:04,get_words,CRITICAL,getting word "third"
2019-01-05T06:43:04,count_words,ERROR,counter 1 for first
2019-01-05T06:43:04,count_words,ERROR,counter 2 for second
2019-01-05T06:43:04,count_words,ERROR,counter 3 for third
```

One of the things this shows,
by the way,
is that Unix doesn't necessarily pass text from program to program one line at a time.
Instead,
it usually [buffers](#g:buffer) input and output.

Libraries like `logging` can send messages to many destinations:
[rotating files](#g:rotating-file) so that the system always has messages from the last few hours
but doesn't fill up the disk,
for example,
or a centralized logging server of some kind that collates logs from many different systems.
You probably don't need any of these,
but the data engineers and system administraotrs who eventually have to install and maintain your programs
will be very grateful that you used `logging`,
because then they can set it up the way they want with very little work.

## How should I log my program's configuration? {#s:logging-config}

One of the most important things a program can record
is its configuration---its *entire* configuration,
so that its operation can be reproduced exactly later on
([CHAPTER](../configure/)).
Unfortunately,
the configuration for even a moderately complex program consists of many values,
and logging frameworks are designed to log one thing at a time.
This leaves us with some hard choices:

Write the configuration to a separate file.
:   If the program can read configuration files,
    then the configuration written by an old run can be read in directly for a new run.
    However,
    we now have to look in two places to find out what happened in a particular run.

Write the configuration to the log, one value at a time.
:   Some programs write name/value pairs, one per setting, at `INFO` level.
    This puts all the information in one place (the log file),
    but someone now has to write software to get configuration values out of the log
    so that they can be re-used.

Write the configuration to the log as one big string.
:   If the configuration is stored in a configuration object,
    that object can be converted to a JSON string
    and written to the log as one looooong entry.
    This puts all of the information in one place,
    and it's relatively easy to recover,
    but the log entry isn't particularly readable.

Use a structured log instead of a line-oriented log.
:   Most log files are written line-by-line because lines of text are the universal language of Unix pipelines.
    Some people are now experimenting with logs that use more structured storage formats,
    and if everything in the log is JSON anyway,
    writing the configuration as a blob of JSON is straightforward.

On balance,
I recommend the third option:
convert the configuration to a JSON structure and write that as a single log entry.
