*I really want to talk about testing now,
because once you have [automated your workflow](../automate/),
you can re-run your tests every time you make a change.
Few things will do more for your productivity,
but after trying for two decades to persuade researchers to write tests,
I've realized that most of you won't---or rather, won't __yet__.
We need to make our problem a little more challenging
to help you see the light.*
