Summary: wordbase.py fails on accented characters
Description:

1.  Create a text file called 'accent.txt' containing the word "Pumpernickel"
    with an umlaut over the 'u'.

2.  Run 'python wordbase.py --all --message accent.txt'

Program should print "Pumpernickel" on a line by itself with the umlaut, but
instead it fails with the message:

    No encoding for [] on line 1 of 'accent.txt'.

([] shows where a solid black box appears in the output instead of a
printable character.)

Versions:
-   `python wordbase.py --version` reports 0.13.1
-   Using on Windows 10.
