The first task in any project is to figure out what you're trying to accomplish.
The best way to do this is write an [elevator pitch](../gloss/#g:elevator-pitch).
Filling out the template below forces you to think about what problem you're trying to solve,
who it affects,
and why your solution is a good one:

1.  **For** target audience
1.  **who** dissatisfaction with what's currently available
1.  **our** category
1.  **provides** key benefit.
1.  **Unlike** alternatives
1.  **our solution** key distinguishing feature.

For example,
here's an elevator pitch for an undergraduate software engineering project:

> For students trying to juggle several group assignments at once
> who find that they drop the ball when communicating by text or email
> our shared online to-do list
> provides an ultra-simple interface that can be used on everything from low-end phones to laptops.
> Unlike most paid and free systems,
> our solution does not display ads and does not collect information about users.

And here's one for a graduate-level research project:

> For astronomers who want to use legacy photographs from Euphoric State University's archives
> who require digital images and are not on campus
> our image processing and indexing application
> provides high-resolution scans of requested photographic plates.
> Unlike existing archival systems,
> our solution gives astronomers images from ESU's archives with 24-hour turnaround.

Elevator pitches are useful,
but writing them is even more so.
Have everyone on the team to fill in the template independently
at the start of each phase of work (e.g., at the start of the semester),
then compare the results.
If your team is like most,
you'll be surprised at how varied the responses are the first couple of times.
One of the things that elevator pitches do is bring these differences out in the open
so that the team can discuss them and (hopefully) reach consensus.
Without that,
unrealized differences can lead to a lot of unnecessary friction.

Once you have an elevator pitch,
put it at the top of the home page for your project,
and use it as the abstract for your [final report](../reports/).
For example,
here's an elevator pitch for these notes:

> For graduate and undergraduate students
> who are doing their first team software project,
> our free online guide to running small software projects
> provides practical step-by-step advice on both tools and practices.
> Unlike books aimed at professional developers,
> our solution assumes that readers have very little prior knowledge and even less time.

-   [Kuch2011](#BIB) is a short, readable guide to making people aware of your work and its value.
-   [Wils2018](#BIB) explains what a [concept map](../gloss/#g:concept-map) is.
    We will revisit these when discussing [software design](../design/),
    but they are as useful for figuring out high-level goals as elevator pitches.
